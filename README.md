# Livery Docs

This repository contains the Markdown files that are converted to the [online documentation](https://docs.liveryvideo.com).

The Markdown is checked with markdownlint and prettier when doing a commit.
It's a good idea to add markdownlint to your IDE to get direct feedback while editing the text.
Use `npm run format` to automatically fix a number of common linting issues and execute prettier to format the tables etc.

Use `npm run lint` to run the linter.

Use `npm start` to run the documentation site locally.
