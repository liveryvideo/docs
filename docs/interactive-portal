Livery Interactive is a cloud based solution which brings true, interactive video within everyone’s reach on web, iOS and android devices. The responsive design ensures that on all devices you can enjoy the same experience.
With our product we provide you a fun and interactive way to enrich your broadcast event and at the same time create engaging experiences that are in perfect sync with the video.
Livery Interactive and Livery Video offered together but both parts of our product can be used separately as well.

On top of the video player sits the interactive layer, this is where your audience will see all interactions when they join your live broadcast event. You can plan, build and play all interactions in an intuitive web-based management system, designed to ensure that even one person can easily manage the elements of your broadcast but it is also supported to let multiple operators work together.

All important video management features are available within the web-based management system to provide an interface where both parts of the Livery product can be managed together.

Within Livery interactive the broadcast is the grouping entity of all the settings and interactions that you’d like to display to your audience during your broadcast event.
The interactions can have the following phases, all managed by the operators in the web-based management system:

- New: a new interaction in the timeline, still editable, not visible for the audience
- Open: the interaction has been played and showed to the audience, the end-users can interact
- Pending: the interaction is closed, end-users can no longer interact with it but the results are not yet published
- Closed: the interaction is closed, the end-users can no longer interact and the results are published

Interactions are grouped into the following packs:
