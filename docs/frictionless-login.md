# Frictionless Auth

Frictionless authentication is a feature that allows users to be granted authorization without requiring them to manually interact with the Livery Interactive Client. For instance, if a user is logged into a customer's platform and there is a Livery Video Player on a web page within that platform, the page can pass a set of credentials to the Livery Video Player, and the Interactive Client will automatically log the user into the Livery system. As a result, the end user doesn't need to log in to the Livery system separately from the surrounding platform, making the authentication process "frictionless".

Livery provides 2 solutions; Verified and Unverified Frictionless, the result of both appoaches is the same but the way the user-date is provided to the Interactive client is different. Unverified Frictionless uses a Javascript method to the interactive client with the user-data. Verified Frictionless validates the recieved user-date via token and requers more effort for the cusotmer to implmeet, but is more secure.
